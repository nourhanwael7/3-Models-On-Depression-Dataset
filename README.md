# 3-Models-On-Depression-Dataset
# Overview
This project explores depression prediction using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and three machine learning models. The goal is to identify key patterns in the data and develop an accurate predictive model, achieving 98% accuracy.
# Project Workflow
1️⃣ EDA: Analyzing trends, correlations, and distributions in the dataset.
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
3️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation: Comparing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to determine the best-performing model.
4️⃣ Results & Insights:

Logistic Regression: Highest accuracy (0.98) and balanced performance. ✅
Random Forest: Strong accuracy (0.95) but struggles with minority class recall. ⚠️
XGBoost: Lower overall performance with 0.54 recall for class 1. ❌
5️⃣ Deployment Recommendation: Logistic Regression is the best choice for deployment due to its consistency and high accuracy.
