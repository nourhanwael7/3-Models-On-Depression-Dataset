# 3-Models-On-Depression-Dataset
# Overview
This project aims to:

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify key factors influencing depression.

Build and evaluate three machine learning models to predict depression:

Random Forest Classifier

Logistic Regression

XGBoost

Compare model performance and select the best model for deployment.
# Dataset :
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikynahidwin/depression-professional-dataset/data
## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn` , `matplotlib`
# Results
Logistic Regression outperformed the other models with an accuracy of 0.98.

Random Forest and XGBoost also performed well but had lower recall for the minority class.
